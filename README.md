# Classification-DogvsCat
This project implemented the classification of DogvsCat in ipynb based on Colab platform.

This project is mainly used to compare the results of classification based on Transfer Learning method.

VGG16, VGG19 base models were chosen to create new TL models, then the models were finetuned by unfrozen different layers in them.

Results based on TensorBoard callbacks will be stored in the logs folder for later review and curve generation.
